            Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as M.S. Dhoni or Captain Cool, is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most successful captains in the history of Indian cricket.
            He was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand), India.
            Dhoni made his debut for the Indian cricket team in December 2004 and quickly rose to prominence with his exceptional leadership skills and cool demeanor on the field.
            He led the Indian cricket team to numerous victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.
            Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the best finishers in limited-overs cricket and is known for his lightning-fast stumping behind the wickets.
            His remarkable career has left an indelible mark on Indian cricket, and he continues to be an inspiration to aspiring cricketers and fans worldwide.

            MS Dhoni’s records include the most number of matches played by an Indian player
             in T20 internationals, with 111 appearances. He has also scored 17 half-centuries
              in T20 internationals, which is more than any other player has managed in this
               format. His record includes the highest score by an Indian batsman in Twenty20
                Internationals
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            His achievements with the bat and glove have earned him several awards,
             including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award twice (2008 & 2009), 
             the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) twice 
             (2008 & 2009), the Wisden Leading Cricketer of the World award twice 
             (2009 & 2013), and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award twice (2008 & 2013).

            M.S. Dhoni is well known for his calm and collected demeanour, even in the
             most stressful circumstances. His leadership skills are unrivalled, 
             and he has led teams to victory frequently. We know him as one of India’s 
             most successful captains, and he is a true inspiration to all aspiring
              cricket players in India.

             Dhoni’s retirement is a huge loss for Indian cricket because of his
              achievements on the field and because he has become a symbol of hope for
               millions worldwide who look up to him as an idol.
